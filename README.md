# Tokyo Olympic Azure Data Engineering Project

## Overview
This project was created to demonstrate data engineering concepts using Azure services.  
I worked on real-world Olympic datasets to design, process, and manage data pipelines.

The goal was to extract meaningful insights from the Tokyo Olympic data using modern cloud technologies.

## Objectives
- To practice building data pipelines.
- To work with Azure Data Factory, Azure Storage, and Azure Synapse.
- To perform data transformation and basic reporting.
- To understand real-world data processing.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Storage Account
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- CSV Data Files
- Data Engineering Concepts

## Project Steps
1. Collected sample datasets related to Tokyo Olympics (Athletes, Coaches, Teams, Medals, Entries by Gender).
2. Stored the data securely in Azure Storage.
3. Built data pipelines to ingest and transform the data.
4. Loaded transformed data into Azure Synapse for analysis.
5. Prepared reports and dashboards based on processed data.

## About the Data
- The datasets include athlete information, team details, medal counts, and event entries.
- Data was slightly modified for learning purposes.

## Key Learnings
- How to create pipelines in Azure Data Factory.
- Understanding data storage, ingestion, and transformation.
- Gaining experience working with cloud-based data solutions.
